                 <p class="items">The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It is a complex process that involves many different steps, but it can be summarized in four main stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.

                     <li><h3>Evaporation</h3></li>
                     <p>Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas. It occurs when water molecules absorb enough heat energy to escape from the surface of a liquid. Evaporation can happen from any body of water, such as oceans, lakes, rivers, and even puddles.
                     </p>
     
                     <li><h3>Condensation</h3></li>
                     <p>Condensation is the process by which water changes from a gas to a liquid. It occurs when water molecules cool down and lose their energy. When this happens, they come together to form clouds.
                     </p>
     
                    <li><h3>Precipitation</h3></li>
                     <p>Precipitation is the process by which water falls from the sky. It can occur in many different forms, such as rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Precipitation occurs when water droplets in clouds become too heavy to stay suspended in the air.
                     </p>
     
                    <li><h3>Collection</h3></li>
                     <p>Collection is the process by which water returns to the Earth's surface. It can happen in a number of ways, such as through runoff, infiltration </p>

            <h2 class="h2" id="fc">Factor effecting climate change: </h2>
            <p class="items_s">Climate change is affecting the water cycle in a number of ways. Here are some of the most important factors:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Rising temperatures:</h3>
                    <p>As the Earth's temperature rises, more water evaporates from the oceans and other bodies of water. This leads to more precipitation, but it also leads to more intense precipitation events, such as hurricanes and floods.
                        Changes in precipitation patterns: Climate change is also causing changes in precipitation patterns. Some areas are becoming wetter, while others are becoming drier. This can lead to droughts in some areas and flooding in others.
                        Melting glaciers and snowpack: Climate change is causing glaciers and snowpack to melt at an accelerated rate. This is reducing the amount of freshwater available for drinking, irrigation, and other uses.
                        </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Sea level rise:</h3>
                    <p>Climate change is causing sea levels to rise. This is due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the expansion of seawater as it warms. Sea level rise is increasing the risk of coastal flooding and erosion.
                        These changes in the water cycle are having a significant impact on human health and the environment. For example, droughts can lead to crop failure, which can lead to food shortages and malnutrition. Floods can damage homes and businesses, and they can also spread diseases. Sea level rise is forcing people to relocate from coastal areas, and it is also inundating wetlands and other important ecosystems.

                <p>Water is essential for life, but not all water is created equal. Only a small fraction of the Earth's water is fresh and available for human consumption. The rest is saltwater, which is undrinkable. Of the freshwater that is available, only a small portion is pure enough to drink without treatment.
                </p><br>
                <p>The availability of pure drinking water is a major concern for many people around the world. According to the World Health Organization, one in three people lack access to safe drinking water. This is due to a number of factors, including pollution, climate change, and population growth.

                <p>The availability of pure drinking water has decreased over time. According to the United Nations, the amount of freshwater available per person has decreased by 60% since 1900. This is due to a number of factors, including:</p>

                <li><h3>Population growth:</h3></li>
                    <p>The world's population has more than tripled since 1900. This means that there are more people competing for the same amount of water.
                        Climate change: Climate change is causing more extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods. This is making it more difficult to access and manage water resources.
                        Pollution: Pollution is contaminating water bodies and making water unsafe to drink.
                        Impact on human health and the environment</p><br>

                        <p>The lack of access to pure drinking water can have a number of negative impacts on human health and the environment. People who drink contaminated water are at risk of contracting waterborne diseases, such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea. Waterborne diseases can be fatal, and they are a major cause of death in children under the age of five.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>The lack of access to pure drinking water can also have a negative impact on the environment. When water is polluted, it can damage ecosystems and harm wildlife. It can also make it more difficult to grow food and produce energy.

                        <p>Protecting water resources: We need to protect our water resources from pollution. This means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, reducing our use of pesticides and herbicides, and properly disposing of waste.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Educating the public: We need to educate the public about the importance of water conservation and the dangers of water pollution. This will help to reduce our water consumption and protect our water resources.

                <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater, with substances that make the water unsafe for drinking, swimming, recreational activities, or for supporting aquatic life. Water pollutants can come from a variety of sources, including:<br>Sewage and wastewater: This can contain harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites.
                    Industrial waste: This can contain heavy metals, toxic chemicals, and other hazardous substances.
